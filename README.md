I'm tired of looking at XMLs, so i automate this task.

Load a XML file from [HP](https://www.hp.com/) product content database and look for missing mandatory content using [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) so the support agent does not have to search for it manually.

Review the mandatory tag, if not found it is returned in a dataframe, capable of reading multiple files
